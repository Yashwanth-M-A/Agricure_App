# **App Name**: AgriAssist

## Core Features:

- Multilingual Onboarding: Guide new users through a multi-step onboarding process, including authentication, language selection, and profile/farm creation with robust validation, and ensure data is persisted and accessible.
- Chatbot Support: Offer 24/7 assistance through an AI chatbot, enabling farmers to ask questions, get advice, and access relevant resources. This will involve a tool for LLM reasoning about whether to incorporate available expert help.
- Personalized Advisory Dashboard: Provide farmers with an advisory dashboard based on weather, soil conditions, market prices, and disease risks to enable informed decision-making. Data will be presented in an actionable way, even for illiterate users, using appropriate translation.
- Voice Assistant: Implement a floating voice assistant that allows farmers to interact with the application hands-free, using voice commands for navigation, information retrieval, and task execution.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Agricultural green (#2E7D32), evoking growth and nature.
- Background color: Light, desaturated farm landscape green (#F0F4F1).
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A66A2D), provides contrast to the green, while reminding of the soil.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a modern yet warm feel. It will provide the application a blend of clarity and approachability for the target user base.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any code snippets, a monospaced sans-serif.
- Use clear and intuitive icons representing different agricultural concepts (crops, equipment, weather, etc.) that are easily recognizable, even by users with low literacy. Also use iconography in onboarding.
- Use subtle animations for loading states, transitions, and user feedback to enhance the user experience without distracting from the core functionality.
